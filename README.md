# CareAndCure
*...Because we care for you :)*

A medical centre requires to store,update and delete huge chunks of data almost everyday. Hence it requires a proper organization of information so that it can be easily retrieved, updated, inserted or deleted.

Files are not turn an easy option for retrieving data easily and quickly and besides this, they also lead to several other problems including redundancy and inconsistency.

Hence to avoid all these problems, we store all the data related to the database in the form of tables and use Database Management Systems to handle it.

Databases have ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) and hence they provide an extremely efficient way for storing and managing data.
Here, in this project, we have aimed at depicting the various aspects involved while creating a medical centre’s database and developed the front end using JDBC.

## Aim

The project provides a menu to the user which primarily provides options to work on the admin’s side and on a user’s side. The menu provides several options to view update and delete records from the tables involved such as DOCTOR, PATIENT, NURSE, RECEPTIONIST ,etc.
